This project describes the complete process of selling a vehicle to a customer from the
dealer’s showroom. Before selling, the vehicle belongs to the fixed asset of the dealer’s
showroom. So the main point of this scenario is posting the vehicle from a fixed asset to a
current asset. While executing the process, the dealer can manually maintain the vehicle
business transaction type, which means, the vehicle can be set as a new or used vehicle to sell
to the customer. This scenario shows the process of new vehicle sales.
